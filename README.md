# One Screen Apart

One Screen Apart is a web app that pairs two people using
socket connections, and enables them to experience touch in an unfamiliar and safe
way. As a response to the restrictions around human interaction
during the Covid-19 pandemic, One Screen Apart aims to combat
physical disconnection during times of isolation and translate the
sensation of touch into a digital environment.
